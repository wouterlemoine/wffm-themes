# How To Contribute

Sass.js is a convenience API for libsass.js which is emscripted from [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass/). That means that the issues pertaining to parsing SCSS are *not* scope of Sass.js. They need to be reported in the [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass/) repository.

In other words, if you can reproduce your issue with either [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) or [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc/) please report your problems to the [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass/) repository.
